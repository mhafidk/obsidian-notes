Hi, I am using Obsidian again, but I use GitHub to sync the notes. In mobile, I use termux, a terminal emulator app, to use git actions, like git push, pull, commit, etc. I need to set up the same setup in my tab.

So far, it works fine. The only little bit annoying things are the manual pull and push, but I think I can work with it.

I almost finish to setup the obsidian-git in my tab.

The setup for my tab is finished. After this I will setup this obsidian-git in my windows laptop.
